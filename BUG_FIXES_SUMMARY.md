# Bug Fixes Summary

This document outlines the 3 critical bugs found and fixed in the Braids Salon Connect application.

## Bug 1: Logic Error - Overly Restrictive Rate Limiting

**Location**: `server.js` lines 18-22

**Problem**: 
The rate limiter was configured to allow only 3 requests per 15 minutes per IP address. This is extremely restrictive for a booking application where users need to:
- Browse multiple salons
- Check availability
- Compare services
- Make bookings

**Impact**: 
- Users would be blocked after just 3 API calls
- Poor user experience
- Application unusable for normal booking flow

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Before
max: 3, // limit each IP to 3 requests per windowMs - TOO RESTRICTIVE

// After  
max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs - reasonable for booking app
```

**Result**: Users can now make up to 100 requests per 15 minutes, which is reasonable for a booking application.

## Bug 2: Performance Issue - Missing Pagination in Bookings

**Location**: `routes/bookings.js` lines 124-139

**Problem**: 
The user bookings endpoint was loading ALL bookings for a user without pagination. This could return thousands of records, causing:
- Memory issues
- Slow response times
- Database performance problems
- Poor user experience

**Impact**:
- High memory usage
- Slow API responses
- Potential server crashes with large datasets
- Poor scalability

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Before
const bookings = await Booking.find(query)
  .populate('salonId', 'name city address phone')
  .sort(options.sort);

// After
const bookings = await Booking.find(query)
  .populate('salonId', 'name city address phone')
  .sort(options.sort)
  .limit(options.limit)
  .skip((options.page - 1) * options.limit);

const total = await Booking.countDocuments(query);
```

**Result**: 
- Proper pagination implemented
- Only loads requested number of records
- Includes pagination metadata (total, totalPages, currentPage)
- Better performance and scalability

## Bug 3: Security Vulnerability - NoSQL Injection

**Location**: 
- `routes/salons.js` line 43
- `server.js` line 183

**Problem**: 
The salon search endpoint was directly assigning user input to MongoDB queries without sanitization. This could allow attackers to:
- Inject malicious MongoDB operators
- Access unauthorized data
- Manipulate query logic
- Potentially access other users' data

**Impact**:
- Data breach risk
- Unauthorized data access
- Application compromise
- Privacy violations

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Before
if (city) {
  query.city = city; // Direct assignment without sanitization
}

// After
if (city) {
  query.city = sanitizeInput(city); // Sanitize input to prevent NoSQL injection
}
```

**Additional Security Improvements**:
1. **Input Validation**: Added ObjectId format validation
2. **Password Strength**: Implemented strong password requirements
3. **Email Validation**: Added proper email format validation
4. **Input Sanitization**: Created utility functions for input sanitization

**Result**:
- NoSQL injection attacks prevented
- Input validation implemented
- Stronger security posture
- Better data protection

## Additional Security Enhancements

### Input Validation
- Added email format validation using regex
- Implemented strong password requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- Added ObjectId format validation for MongoDB queries

### Input Sanitization
- Created `sanitizeInput()` utility function
- Removes potentially dangerous characters
- Prevents script injection and NoSQL injection

### Error Handling
- Improved error messages
- Better error codes for different scenarios
- Consistent error response format

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Test with multiple requests to ensure proper limiting
2. **Pagination**: Test with large datasets to verify pagination works correctly
3. **Security**: Test with malicious input to ensure injection attacks are prevented
4. **Input Validation**: Test with invalid emails, weak passwords, and malformed IDs

## Files Modified

1. `server.js` - Fixed rate limiting, input validation, and NoSQL injection
2. `routes/bookings.js` - Implemented proper pagination
3. `routes/salons.js` - Added input sanitization
4. `utils/validation.js` - Created validation utilities
5. `middleware/auth.js` - Enhanced authentication middleware

All bugs have been successfully identified and fixed, significantly improving the application's security, performance, and user experience.
