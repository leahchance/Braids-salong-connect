# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following Expo assets:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image 
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

## Placeholder Assets

Since no assets were provided, you'll need to add these files for the app to build properly.

You can:
1. Create your own assets matching the dimensions above
2. Use placeholder assets from [Expo's documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/app-icons/)
3. Generate assets using tools like [Figma](https://figma.com) or [Canva](https://canva.com)

## Quick Setup

For development, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders:
- Create 1024x1024px images with your brand colors
- Save them with the correct filenames in this directory
